# Coding Guidelines

Our conventions are based on the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/). This document extends these with additional guidelines.

## Documentation

Documentation enables local reasoning - it's a shortcut for understanding so readers can avoid looking up implementation or usages to infer meaning.

- Every declaration outside a function body must have a documentation comment that describes its contract.
  - Start with a summary sentence fragment.
    - Describe what a function or method does and what it returns.
    - Describe what a property or type is.
    - Separate the fragment from any additional documentation with a blank line and end it with a period.

  - Preconditions, postconditions and invariants obviously implied by the summary need not be explicitly documented.

  - Declarations that fulfill protocol requirements are exempted when nothing useful can be added to the documentation of the protocol requirement itself.

- Document the performance of every operation that doesn't execute in constant time and space, unless it's obvious from the summary.
- Test cases need not be documented, but should have a descriptive function name.

- Phrasing conventions:
  - Omit needless words: don't repeat the receiver's type, don't write `the`, `given`, `of self`, `of the current object` when context makes these obvious.
  - Use `iff` instead of `if` where applicable.
  - Use `<...>, if any.` for optional values where the absence reason is obvious. Otherwise: `<...> if <condition>, nil otherwise.`
  - Document preconditions with `- Requires:`. If multiple preconditions apply, use a markdown list below `- Requires:`.

## Contracts

- Create the strictest contracts possible, so long as the client can reason about the preconditions locally.
- Preconditions and postconditions are relationships between components - think in terms of what the caller must provide and what the callee guarantees in return.
- Contract evolution: you may safely weaken preconditions and strengthen postconditions. The reverse breaks clients, so you must inspect all call sites before introducing the change.
- When a contract seems too strict to use correctly without accidentally breaking preconditions, you can either relax the preconditions (e.g. `demandModule(name:)` - gets or creates the module if it doesn't exist yet) or report an error/return an optional (e.g. `myHashmap[key]` - returns nil if key is not found).

## Errors

Distinguish bugs from runtime errors:
- **Bug**: a programming mistake. Stop before more damage is done.
- **Runtime error**: postconditions can't be met despite correct usage. Respond by `throw`ing or returning an optional/result.

When to use each termination mechanism:
- **`precondition(condition, "message")`** - the caller violated a documented requirement. Checked in all builds.
- **`assert(condition, "message")`** - an internal invariant that should hold if the implementation is correct. Checked only in debug builds.
- **`unreachable("message")`** - a code path that is logically impossible given the surrounding control flow or type system.
- **`unimplemented("feature name")`** - a stub for functionality not yet written.
- **`fatalError("message")`** - avoid this, either `unreachable()` or `unimplemented()` should be used instead. If you don't expect it to be unreachable nor unimplemented, prefer reporting an error with throw or returning `nil`.

Reporting errors:
- Avoid typed `throws` unless you are confident that the immediate caller will be interested in handling the error, and it doesn't just use its description but is interested in the specific error type. Otherwise, you would expose implementation details that propagate through your program's APIs virally.
- Avoid silently swallowing invalid input that would lead to accepting undesirable inputs; report and propagate errors instead.

## Safety

- When using an unsafe or unchecked construct (e.g. `@unchecked Sendable`), include a comment that justifies the need and explains why it's safe.

## Algorithms

- Prefer named algorithms over inline loops. A loop is a mechanism; a named algorithm is a statement of intent.
- When a suitable algorithm doesn't exist, create one as an extension on the appropriate type (`Sequence`, `Collection`, etc.) rather than inlining the loop at the call site.
- Structure data so efficient algorithms become possible (e.g. storing something in an ordered collection for binary search, or storing in a hashmap for O(1) lookup).

## Types

- Use strong types to encode invariants. If a value can only be valid in certain states, make invalid states unrepresentable.
- Every instance of a type should have exactly one clearly-defined value, expressed in terms of its operations.
- Keep the efficient basis of a type small and well-documented. All other operations should be derivable from it.
- Prefer value types. Reference types (`class`) are appropriate only for identity, shared mutable state, or non-copyable resources—document why.

## Naming

- Name mutating methods with imperative verb phrases; name nonmutating variants with past participle or `ing` forms.
- No abbreviations in APIs unless universally known (e.g. `URL`, `ID`).
- Name variables, parameters, and associated types according to their roles, rather than their type constraints.
- Compensate for weak type information to clarify a parameter’s role: if the type is too weak, a qualified argument label can help (e.g. `f(outputDirectory: URL)`). But prefer making the type more strict to capture the invariants (e.g. `f(output: DirectoryURL)`).
- Single-letter names are fine in small scopes: `l`/`r` for binary operators, `n` for a syntax node, `m` for a module, `i`/`j` for indices.
- When naming a collection of objects, use a plural form (even in case of short names): `files`, `xs`, `ms`.
- Prefer descriptive labels over `for` as a parameter label.

## Testing

- All new code should be covered by tests.
- Tests should exercise the contract: verify postconditions under valid preconditions.
- (Death tests are not supported in Swift XCTest, but it would be nice to write tests that exercise that libraries uphold safety by crashing correctly on precondition violations.)

## Formatting

- Indent with 2 spaces.
- Use a 100-column line limit.
- Add blank lines inside type, extension, and enum declarations - leave one empty line after the opening brace and before the closing brace.
- Separate protocol conformances into their own extensions unless it's a marker protocol.
- Use explicit named parameters in parentheses for multi-statement closures: `{ element in ... }`. Use `$0` shorthand only in short, single-expression closures.
- Use `// MARK:` comments to organize sections in large files.
- Use `///` for documentation comments.
- Use `self.` in initializers when assigning to stored properties.

## File names

All Swift source files end with the extension `.swift` and all Hylo source files end with the extension `.hylo`.

In general, a file is named after the main entity that it defines. A file that extends an existing type with a protocol (Swift) or trait (Hylo) conformance is named with a combination of the type name and the protocol or trait name, joined with a plus (`+`) sign. For more complex situations, exercise your best judgment.

For example:

- A Swift file defining a type named MyType is named MyType.swift.
- A Swift file defining how MyType conforms to Equatable is named MyType+Equatable.swift.
- Retroactive conformances can be added in `MyType+Extensions.swift`.

Avoid defining multiple types, protocols, or traits in the same file unless they are scoped by a main entity or meant to
be used only in that file. Usually, conformances and custom error types are small and are defined in the same file as 
the type to which they apply.
